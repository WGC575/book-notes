# Software Architecture - Foundations, Theory and Practice

Authored by Richard, Nenad, and Eric

## 1 - The Big Idea

## 1.1 The Power of Analogy: The Architecture of Buildings

We can use an analogy from the architecture of buildings to help us understand the architectures of software. And both share some principles.

- Architecture exists, independent of, but closely related to the entity (buildings, applications, or code).
- Properties are determined by architecture designs.
- Being a good architects not only requires technical proficiency, but also the knowledge that contribute to improving user experience.
- Architecture precedes process and is prior to process.
- Domain knowledge exists for architecture and evolves over iterations.

### 1.1.1 Limitations of Analogy

Analogy is helpful, but limited.

- We have much more knowledge about building than software architecture.
- Physically speaking, the essences of buildings and software are different.

### 1.1.2 Big Idea

Give preeminence to architecture, and it will offer the potential for realizing :

- Intellectual control
- Conceptual integrity
- An adequate and effective basis for reuse
- Effective project communication
- Management of a set of related variant systems

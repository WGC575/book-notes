## 1 - The Big Idea

## 1.1 The Power of Analogy: The Architecture of Buildings

We can use an analogy from the architecture of buildings to help us understand the architectures of software. And both share some principles.

- Architecture exists, independent of, but closely related to the entity (buildings, applications, or code).
- Properties are determined by architecture designs.
- Being a good architects not only requires technical proficiency, but also the knowledge that contribute to improving user experience.
- Architecture precedes process and is prior to process.
- Domain knowledge exists for architecture and evolves over iterations.

### 1.1.1 Limitations of Analogy

- We have much more knowledge about building than software architecture.
